Fuel My Future

An AI-powered platform that provides personalized feedback on resumes and interview performance to reduce friction in the job application process.

Problem
Many job applicants lack access to actionable, personalized feedback. Existing solutions are often time-intensive, generalized, or socially uncomfortable, leading to inefficient iteration and weaker applications.

Solution Overview
Fuel My Future is an integrated platform that simulates interview environments and analyzes resumes using AI-driven feedback systems. It enables iterative improvement by storing user history and benchmarking performance over time.

Key Features
Mock Interview System
- Simulates real interview conditions and generates targeted feedback on weak areas.
Resume Feedback Engine
- Provides structured critique on resume content and phrasing using AI analysis.
Progress Tracking (My Results)
- Tracks user improvement across multiple attempts to enable data-driven iteration.
Document Hub
- Stores artifacts and allows longitudinal comparison of application materials.

How It Works 
The system processes user inputs (resume text or interview responses) and routes them through an AI feedback pipeline. For interviews, responses are evaluated against expected answer structures and common failure patterns. For resumes, the system analyzes clarity, specificity, and alignment with job expectations, returning targeted suggestions.
